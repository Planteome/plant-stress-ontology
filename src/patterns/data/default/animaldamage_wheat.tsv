PSO:0000747	wheat cereal cyst nematode damage	NCBITaxon:157856	NCBITaxon:4565	PO:0009005				APSNET:Wheat|PSO:cooperl|0000-0002-9013-5974	Symptoms and signs: Aboveground symptoms are more visible on seedlings than older plants. Plants grow poorly in uneven patches randomly distributed throughout the field. Symptoms on roots are different depending upon host. A much-branched root system in charateristics. Root division takes place at the point of juvenile invasion, giving the appearance of bushy, knotted root system. Several white females, in the form of cysts, are usually visible at each knot. The cysts are a glistening white gray initially and dark brown when mature.
PSO:0000748	wheat root-knot nematode damage	NCBITaxon:42426	NCBITaxon:4565	PO:0009005				APSNET:Wheat|PSO:cooperl|0000-0002-9013-5974	Symptoms and signs: Root-knot nematodes cause large galls, or knots, on the roots of dicotyledonous plants. The galls induced on wheat roots are usually small, clublike thickenings.
PSO:0000749	wheat root-lesion nematode damage	NCBITaxon:3082208	NCBITaxon:4565	PO:0009005				APSNET:Wheat|PSO:cooperl|0000-0002-9013-5974	Symptoms and signs: The root damage caused by nematode feeding and migration often within the roots results in extansive cortical damage, disrupting root function.
